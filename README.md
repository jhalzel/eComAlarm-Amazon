"""
This script retrieves data from Amazon's SP-API for seller accounts and updates a dashboard with sales information.

The main functionality of the script is to fetch data from the API and update the frontend dashboard with the latest sales information. It also includes functionality to set sales thresholds and send notifications when those thresholds are reached.

The script consists of the following files:
- `script.py`: Retrieves data from the API.
- `trial.py`: Flask application that forwards data between the frontend and backend and calls the main function in `script.py`.
- `actions.yaml`: Cron schedule that periodically calls the `script.py` function to update the data on the frontend.

The application is hosted on Render to prevent it from spinning down every 15 minutes. The cron schedule serves a dual purpose of keeping the app running and updating the frontend data.

Note: This documentation is a high-level overview of the project. For detailed information about each file and its functions, please refer to the individual file's documentation.
